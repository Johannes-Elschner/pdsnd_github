# Explore US Bikeshare Data

### Bike Share Data
Over the past decade, bicycle-sharing systems have been growing in number and popularity in cities across the world.
Thanks to the rise in information technologies, it is easy for a user of the system to access a dock within the system to unlock or return bicycles. These technologies also provide a wealth of data that can be used to explore how these bike-sharing systems are used.
### Project Description
In this project, we use the data provided by [Motivate](https://www.motivateco.com/), a bike share system provider for many major cities in the United States, to uncover bike share usage patterns. We compare the system usage between three large cities: **Chicago**, **New York City**, and **Washington, DC**.
### The Datasets
Randomly selected data for the first six months of 2017 are provided for all three cities.
- **chicago.csv**
- **new_york_city.csv**
- **washington.csv**

All three of the data files contain the same six core columns:
- **Start Time** *(e.g., 2017-01-01 00:07:57)*
- **End Time** *(e.g., 2017-01-01 00:20:53)*
- **Trip Duration** *(in seconds - e.g., 776)*
- **Start Station** *(e.g., Broadway & Barry Ave)*
- **End Station** *(e.g., Sedgwick St & North Ave)*
- **User Type** *(Subscriber or Customer)*

The Chicago and New York City files also have the following two columns:
- **Gender**
- **Birth Year**

### Credit
At this point I would like to thank the people from **[UDACITY](https://www.udacity.com/)** for teaching me all this cool stuff. :mortar_board::sunglasses::+1:
